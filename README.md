# Oglaf Meta

The purpose of this project is to identify past strips from the __[Oglaf](https://oglaf.com/)__ webcomic,
with the ability to add tags to strips so they can be correlated with others.

The project comes with code and a curated assemblage of information:
1. __html2json__: Code to generate or _update_ metadata about individual strips
2. __tag__: Code to _search_ for strips by tag, and to add/delete tag data
3. __archive.json__: Metadata about past strips as generated by the code in this project
4. __tags.json__: Keywords related to individual strips
5. __characters.png__: A helpful graphic of recurring characters, with names, based on the
original work of [/u/Fraxinopolis](https://old.reddit.com/u/Fraxinopolis) as posted [in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/oglaf/comments/ijbsb9/chart_of_recurring_characters/)

I would highly value pull requests with more tag data in tags.json - specifically 
mapping named characters to the strips they appear in.  Feel free to submit pull 
requests if you find errors or discrepancies in this code or the tagging.

## Setup
To set up your environment to run this project on Linux or MacOS:
``` shell
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Review the help text
See the tools' options by running:
``` shell
./html2json -h
```
or:
``` shell
./tag -h
```

The tools put in a small effort to save you from yourself but, really, the onus is
on you not to shoot yourself in the foot.  I recommend backing up your `archive.json`
and `tags.json` files just in case you mess something up and want to revert back.


## Working with tags
Search for a tag:
``` shell
./tag -title "cumsprite" -t Mistress -t Ivan
```

Add a tag to one or more strips:
``` shell
./tag -a -title "cumsprite" -t Mistress -t Ivan
```

## Updating Archive Data (DEFAULT behavior)
If you already have an _archive.json_ (which you should, since one comes with this project),
but you want to update it with new strip data, you can do it with:
```shell
./html2json -u
```

## Generating all new Archive Data
Maybe you want to rebuild _archive.json_?  Not to despair, you can do it with: 
``` shell
./html2json -r
```
